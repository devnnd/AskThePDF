# AskThePDF

An AI-powered application to have conversations with your PDF documents.

## How It Works

This project uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. When you upload a PDF, it's processed into smaller chunks, converted into vector embeddings, and stored in a Pinecone database. When you ask a question, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks to provide the AI with the context it needs to give a precise, accurate answer.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js | TypeScript | RAG | Pinecone | AWS S3 | Tailwind CSS
